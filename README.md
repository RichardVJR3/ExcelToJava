# ExcelToJava
This was my final project for my CSC 110 class.
The goal of this project was to import an Excel sheet into a usable format on a displayed window
Using the spreadsheet you can add up to 4 items in a list and it will print them out accordingly.
This program originally was used as a means of displaying monster drops from the game Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak.
